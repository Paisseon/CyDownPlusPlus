# CyDown++

A modified version of Julioverne's CyDown tweak. Some repos found a bug in Julio's and used it to prevent downloads. This one patches the bug so you encounter fewer errors.

**I can't open source the entire thing because I don't have the source code from Julio, only the changes Sudo and I made**
